## Description
Lets Cook is mobile application designed to share culinary experiences between people.
## 🤹🏻 Features
- **Chat**. App allows users to exchange messages
- **Comments**. Users can add comments to recipes (not implemented)
- **Auth**. Registration and authorization are implemented in the application
- **Recipes**. You can add recipes and watch other
## 📑 Requirements
React Native apps may target iOS 10.0 and Android 4.1 (API 16) or newer. You may use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, though building and running iOS apps is limited to macOS. Tools like Expo can be used to work around this.
As a package manager, I recommend using yarn.
## 🧱 Building app
- start emulator or connect the phone to PC (early turn on developer mode)
- yarn install
- expo start
- after metro 
## 🖼️ UI layout
The layout and main prototypes of the application were developed in [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/i5pjp8zRtAoDFKxBm2dRmT/Lets-cook-mobile-app?node-id=0%3A1).
